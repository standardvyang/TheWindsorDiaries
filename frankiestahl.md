# Please Stop Harassing Me, Frankie Stahl

### Introduction

I feel the need to defend myself because **Frankie Stahl, a 53-year-old homeowner**, has been **bullying** **me,** **a transgender Asian woman less than half her age.**  I don't have money. I am a humble renter in this town and all I have are my words and my reputation.


I don't know what to do to get her to stop, and I have done nothing wrong.

I don't feel safe because she is on the local review team, and she's been responding to my posts with very offensive comments about my character, and I feel like I can't simply mute her because otherwise people will believe it.

**I have never, ever engaged with her in a political conversation unless she initiated it first**. She had given me her phone number and we had had coffee to discuss zoning policy once.

It was only after she had lashed out and got angry at me for discussing the existence of racism in the town of Windsor, that I sent her a [**private** text message telling her that I was cutting her out of my life, due to her extreme defensiveness and hostility to discussing racial equality.](https://i.imgur.com/oNGX5vd.jpg) I attempted to end this friendship which had made me feel deeply uncomfortable. Out of respect for a former friend, I chose to do this in a *quiet* and *private* manner. I spoke to nobody about this conflict, until Frankie Stahl escalated it to the public sphere.

She proceeded to **publicly** post about this social conflict and accuse me of stirring up drama. This is why I am now publicly posting about this, because Frankie Stahl has escalated it and put me in a position where I must defend myself.

A few days ago on NextDoor, I had made a post discussing my experience with [racism](https://i.imgur.com/qy01aCn.jpg) in this town (a different person had told me to "go back to Asia"). **Frankie responded with an accusation that I was lying about my experience with racism**, and proceeded to misrepresent my earlier text. She then expressed anger at me for not addressing her complaints, until I relented. 

To repeat: She demanded that I explain why I wasn't comfortable being her friend, and told me that my reasoning was wrong.

And to be clear: I have met this woman a total of one time in my life. Every single conversation on NextDoor we have had, she initiated. I attempted to distance myself from her and she ended up retaliating for that.

So I wrote another text (which linked to an earlier version of this page) which you will find below, in the hopes that she will leave me alone.

**All I want** in this town is to fix the racism and to build more affordable housing. I just want to get back to that and not have to worry about this person.

# An Open Letter to Frankie Stahl

---

**Frankie Says**: In your text you attacked my owning a home.

**Standard's Response**: No. I pointed out your privilege in *owning* a home in one of Windsor's richest neighborhoods, and made a suggestion that you use some of that privilege to learn about the history of segregation. **This was not an attack.** I did not say you were a bad person for owning a home.  This was me speaking to someone who had the power to help make things right. 

**If you don't like the responsibility that comes with power, then give up the power.**

----

**Frankie Says**: [You] accused me of bigotry[.]

**Standard's Response**: My texts were *carefully* and *precisely* worded. I made two points, both of which I stand by:

### Point 1: I, Standard Duong, have no time for white fragility.

Robin DiAngelo defines white fragility as such:

>  The smallest amount of racial stress is intolerableâ€”the mere suggestion that being white has meaning often triggers a range of defensive responses. These include emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and withdrawal from the stress-inducing situation.

I add to that definition: the mere suggestion that one could accidentally be abetting racism triggers a range of defensive responses.

**You lashed out**. You got angry and defensive when I made a simple statement of fact: We are living with [the remnants, the legacy, of racial segregation](https://www.kqed.org/news/11840548/the-racist-history-of-single-family-home-zoning). You attempted to censor a comment pointing out this fragility, at which point *I made a decision to cut my losses and move on*.

Once again, I repeat: I, **Standard Duong**, have no time for *white fragility*. I am not privileged enough to spend my time coddling the emotions of privileged people in order to get them to listen. They can afford the time and money to actually afford professional and academic help with their misconceptions. I have to work to feed myself. I have to work to save my friends in poverty. 

**Why** would I bother spending my free time, *giving free therapy* to a *very privileged person?* 
**Why** would I subject myself to the *indignities* of walking on eggshells, for free?
**Finally, why**  would I do it for someone who associates with *known bigots*?

### Point 2: You, Frankie Stahl, are *complicit* in bigotry.

This does not mean that you are engaging in bigotry. This means that you *stand by* and *let it happen*. Not only that, you associate yourself with people who have no interest in learning tolerance.

At the time of writing, you are a member of the Conservatives of Windsor. The COWs have engaged in bigotry. There are many examples of such. These are not isolated incidents, as Gary Doering is in charge of the group and even participated in some of this hate speech.

These are all posts which have been made in the group.

#### Example 1 - [The admin's hate speech against Muslims](https://i.imgur.com/raNdQDy.jpg)

The [second link that the admin posted](https://thenewstalkers.com/community/discussion/37284/beware-of-liberals-relocating-to-your-city) in the screenshot is blatantly Islamophobic, [accusing Muslim immigrants of "hating America"](https://i.imgur.com/EASJpLO.png)

#### Example 2 - [Bigoted slurs against the LGBT used by the admin](https://i.imgur.com/MDm01U3.png)

#### Example 3 - [Another member of the COWs, currently a person on the local review team. Seen comparing transgenders to "groomers", a word associated with pedophiles](https://i.imgur.com/JZgVHCo.png)

#### Example 4 - [Another member of the COWS, calls transgenders "SICK SICK EVIL" people](https://i.imgur.com/8sy6AMT.png)

### In Conclusion

I have nothing to apologize for. You literally demanded I respond to you. You mocked me for not responding. You, a woman twice my age, called me lost for not writing a letter. Okay, now you have your explanation. Please stop harassing me, Frankie Stahl. 

Sincerely, 

Standard Duong
