# The Windsor Diaries

I moved here in 2021, and I'm not sure if I'm going to stay or go.

It all depends on what I can do here.

Can I get this town to welcome the poor, can I get this town to welcome minorities?

I could fill up pages and pages with how angry I am at the locals who are trying to keep them out. I probably will, but I also have to keep in mind that winning the hearts and minds of this town involves both facts and feelings.

The challenge is to weave them both in a coherent, elegant, welcoming way.

## The Apartments

A lot of people in this town are mad about a set of apartments being built. You'd think, "Oh, are they building it on top of a cemetery? A Vietnam war memorial, perhaps?"

No! People just  want to build it on top of a parking lot that's not even paved.

Of course, people have reasons for why they oppose the apartments on that dirt parking lot. 

They worry about [crime rates] and [increased traffic].

They talk about the [environment], even though apartments and five-story buildings are better at conserving nature.

They talk about the ["small-town feel"], a phrase that tells everything and nothing at the same time.

Some say, "but it's not affordable housing!"


## Cadillacs and Corollas

In 2021, there was a shortage of those little computer chips that go into new cars. So, they stopped making as many new cars, and a bunch of rich people who wanted new cars decided to settle for less new cars. 

Of course, nobody makes used cars. So when a bunch of extra people wanted to buy used cars, the price of them went up.

Anyway, so we can see this happen in the housing market. If you stop people from building a six-story apartment on a *dirt parking lot*,

you'll still have the same amount of people, aiming for a limited supply of housing.

Housing prices go up, and the poor lose out. But hey, at least the upper-middle class can keep their parking lot!

It would be such a tragedy if they had to park a bit further away to walk to the lake - or, god forbid, carpool.

## But My Parking

1. You don't need to drive a car to get everywhere if things are closer together.

2. If you're not dense enough for busses, try [minivan fleets!](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1111765630/on-demand-shuttles-have-replaced-buses-in-a-small-north-carolina-town)

## But Crime Rates

1. Crime rates don't necessarily correlate with density. Looking at crime rates on a city level is misleading because crime isn't evenly distributed across the entire region.

2. You think that crime is more frequent in urban areas, but it might just be because [people are more likely to report a crime in urban areas.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15MphYRu66Zspv5IKhBKR-CjYuzVb3u5J/view?usp=drivesdk)

## But My Small Town Feel 

It's possible to have a small-town feel while also having density! See [this video.](https://twitter.com/edwardlamb/status/1573228176217722880?t=ZiVfNj9ye42Dw525ZicSLQ&s=19)

# Things I've Read

### Famine, Affluence, and Morality

Peter Singer posits a hypothetical: "Would you ruin your clothes to save a child from drowning?"

And he carries on that line of conversation, starting with the premise that yes, we *would* be willing to sacrifice a bit of our own comfort to improve the lives of others.

So if we're willing to do that to help someone nearby, why not sacrifice to help someone far away?

### The Bioshock Series

```
Are You Afraid Of God? 

No, I'm Afraid Of You.
```

There is this phrase that I keep hearing many variations of: "I worked for everything I got, so everyone else should have to too". Notably, many of those people were privileged enough to be born on the right side of the border, in the right place, in the right time, in the right skin color. Other people work just as hard as them, but circumstances mean that they're not in the same position in life.

The Bioshock series shows worlds where this sentiment is the commanding mantra, and shows the pain and suffering that it brings. What happens in a world run by men with these ideas?
