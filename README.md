# The Windsor Diaries

To be honest, I really didn't have much of a choice in moving here.

Basically I moved to Windsor, Colorado in June 2021 because it was the best option for me. I'd come out as trans in 2020, which put them on the verge of disowning me, which they eventually did. 

Anyway, the awkward part was that I didn't have any money to leave my family. Plus I had no ability to work because I needed time to process the past. 

But then I met a person online, who I had never met or talked to before, and he offered to let me stay in his house for a very low price: cooking in exchange for rent. One zoom call later, I bought a ticket from Los Angeles. A month later, I landed in Denver, got picked up, and headed to Windsor for a chance at some peace and quiet.

Hopefully, I'll be able to get a software engineering job soon. If my math is right, I'll no longer be in debt by the end of 2023. After my bottom surgery at the end of 2024, I won't have as much daily physical pain. By the end of 2025, I'll have enough money to actually choose where I want to live.

At the time of writing, I'm still not sure if I'll end up choosing to stay or deciding to go. Really, it all depends on what I can do here.

Can I get this town to welcome the poor, can I get this town to welcome minorities?

See, one tricky part is that it's hard to even *talk* about how [racism has affected the policies of this town.](https://www.kqed.org/news/11840548/the-racist-history-of-single-family-home-zoning)

Let me be absolutely clear, here: not everyone who disagrees is racist. However, it is very possible to accidentally support an oppressive policy.

Getting that across is part of the challenge.

# Hard break

the rest of this site is less organized. it's mostly summaries of discussions i've had with other people.


## A Sustainable Windsor Is A Denser Windsor

## A Denser Windsor Is A Healthier Windsor 

## The Small Town Feel 

It's possible to have a small-town feel while also having density! See [this video.](https://twitter.com/edwardlamb/status/1573228176217722880?t=ZiVfNj9ye42Dw525ZicSLQ&s=19)

## The Parking

1. You don't need to drive a car to get everywhere if things are closer together.

2. If you're not dense enough for busses, try [minivan fleets!](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1111765630/on-demand-shuttles-have-replaced-buses-in-a-small-north-carolina-town)


## The Crime Rates

1. Crime rates don't necessarily correlate with density. Looking at crime rates on a city level is misleading because crime isn't evenly distributed across the entire region.

2. You think that crime is more frequent in urban areas, but it might just be because [people are more likely to report a crime in urban areas.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15MphYRu66Zspv5IKhBKR-CjYuzVb3u5J/view?usp=drivesdk)

## The Land Value

Building more density does not [hurt the value of your single-family home.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CAjpdHg38B5sIs-ijxQp_MAQHfCXN4ar/view?usp=drivesdk)

## The Apartments

A lot of people in this town are mad about a set of apartments being built. You'd think, "Oh, are they building it on top of a cemetery? A Vietnam war memorial, perhaps?"

No! People just  want to build it on top of a parking lot that's not even paved.

Of course, people have reasons for why they oppose the apartments on that dirt parking lot. 

They worry about [crime rates] and [increased traffic].

They talk about the [environment], even though apartments and five-story buildings are better at conserving nature.

They talk about the ["small-town feel"], a phrase that tells everything and nothing at the same time.

Some say, "but it's not affordable housing!"


## Cadillacs and Corollas

In 2021, there was a shortage of those little computer chips that go into new cars. So, they stopped making as many new cars, and a bunch of rich people who wanted new cars decided to settle for less new cars. 

Of course, nobody makes used cars. So when a bunch of extra people wanted to buy used cars, the price of them went up.

Anyway, so we can see this happen in the housing market. If you stop people from building a six-story apartment on a *dirt parking lot*,

you'll still have the same amount of people, aiming for a limited supply of housing.

Housing prices go up, and the poor lose out. But hey, at least the upper-middle class can keep their parking lot!

It would be such a tragedy if they had to park a bit further away to walk to the lake - or, god forbid, carpool.

## Famine, Affluence, and Morality

Peter Singer posits a hypothetical: "Would you ruin your clothes to save a child from drowning?"

And he carries on that line of conversation, starting with the premise that yes, we *would* be willing to sacrifice a bit of our own comfort to improve the lives of others.

So if we're willing to do that to help someone nearby, why not sacrifice to help someone far away?

```
Are You Afraid Of God? 

No, I'm Afraid Of You.
```

There's this phrase that I keep hearing many variations of: "I worked for everything I got, so everyone else should have to, too". 

Notably, many of those people were privileged enough to be born on the right side of the border, in the right place, in the right time, in the right skin color. Other people work just as hard as them, but circumstances mean that they're not in the same position in life.


The Bioshock series shows worlds where this sentiment is the commanding mantra, and shows the pain and suffering that it brings. What happens in a world run by men with these ideas?
