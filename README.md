# The Windsor Diaries

## Biography

To be honest, I really didn't have much of a choice in moving here.

Basically I moved to Windsor, Colorado in Spring 2021 because it was the best option for me. I'd come out as trans around 2020, which put my parents on the verge of disowning me, which they eventually did. 

Anyway, the awkward part was that I didn't have any money to leave my family. Plus I had no ability to work because I needed time to process the past. 

But then I met a person online, who I had never met or talked to before, and he offered to let me stay in his house for a very low price: cooking in exchange for rent. One zoom call later, I bought a ticket from Los Angeles. A month later, I landed in Denver, got picked up, and headed to Windsor for a chance at some peace and quiet.

Hopefully, I'll be able to get a software engineering job soon. If my math is right, I'll no longer be in debt by the end of 2024. After my bottom surgery at the end of 2025, I won't have as much daily physical pain. By the end of 2026, I'll have enough money to actually choose where I want to live.

At the time of writing, I'm still not sure if I'll end up choosing to stay or deciding to go. Really, it all depends on what I can do here.

Can I get this town to welcome the poor, can I get this town to welcome minorities?

## Fortunate Son

So, like - have you ever been at a party or something and someone says something that's kind of messed up, but nobody else decides to point it out? 

So that's what being a minority is like on NextDoor for Windsor, Colorado. Like, I can say something pretty tame like "Hey uh, this local law can be traced back to segregation and jim crow, we should probably do something about that" And one of the responses will be like, "Blah blah blah how would you like it if I moved to Asia and told everyone there how to live?"

In the business, we call that a microaggression. On *NextDoor*, it gets 13 heart reacts from other locals. 

I could tell them that I was actually born in America. That I know half the lyrics to Fortunate Son, but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't care.

## A Random Walk Down Ohio

So one time I accidentally ended up in Ohio and decided to spend a day or two in Columbus. I think I was checking out the statues in front of a state government building when I saw a plaque on a bronze soldier.

The plaque said something like, ["we honor the Ohio veterans of the Philippine insurrection."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_%2798)

The Philippine insurrection? A plaque honoring war criminals who were putting down an independence movement? 

To be clear - *America was very clearly the bad guy in that whole thing*. This wasn't like Kosovo. We literally threw Filipinos into [concentration camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concentration_and_internment_camps#Philippines) just because they were fighting for independence from... us! There was attempted genocide!

Anyway, I'm pretty sure if I went on NextDoor for Columbus, Ohio and made a post about how we should probably fix that statue, I'd get the same ol' "blah blah blah if you don't like our town so much, just move" spiel that I get on Windsor.

## Skeletons In The Closet

So, Windsor isn't like Columbus, Ohio. There's no statue of any war criminals in this town (I'm 90% sure). But, you know, we do have these housing laws that are still enforced and can be traced back to Jim Crow.

And ooooh boy, a lot of people really don't like learning about that part of our history.

But I get it. People really like single-family homes. They like it so much that they don't like seeing housing that isn't single-family. In fact, they'll ban apartments in half the town so that single-family homes are more common. They *really, really* like exclusionary zoning. I'm sure it sucks to find out that that whole thing has its roots in [ethnic segregation.](https://sf.streetsblog.org/2021/02/04/spur-talk-the-racist-roots-of-single-family-zoning/)

Like, imagine finding out that mint chocolate chip ice cream was racist. You'd be like, "oh man, but i really like mint chocolate chip ice cream!"

So it sucks finding out that the thing you like is bad. Still, it doesn't make you a bad person. But getting both those points across is tricky.

Here's a book that goes more into this called [The Color of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_of_Law). If the [Clearview Library](https://catalog.clearviewlibrary.org/search/searchresults.aspx?ctx=1.1033.0.0.6&type=Keyword&term=the%20color%20of%20law&by=KW&sort=RELEVANCE&limit=TOM=*&query=&page=0&searchid=1) doesn't have it, the Amazon link is [here!](https://www.amazon.com/Color-Law-Forgotten-Government-Segregated/dp/1631492853)

the rest of this site is less organized. it's mostly summaries of discussions i've had with other people.


## A Sustainable Windsor Is A Denser Windsor

## The Small Town Feel 

It's possible to have a small-town feel while also having density! See [this video.](https://twitter.com/edwardlamb/status/1573228176217722880?t=ZiVfNj9ye42Dw525ZicSLQ&s=19)

## The Parking

1. You don't need to drive a car to get everywhere if things are closer together.

2. If you're not dense enough for busses, try [minivan fleets!](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1111765630/on-demand-shuttles-have-replaced-buses-in-a-small-north-carolina-town)


## The Crime Rates

1. Crime rates don't necessarily correlate with density. Looking at crime rates on a city level is misleading because crime isn't evenly distributed across the entire region. See [video here](https://youtu.be/m4jG1i7jHSM).
2. You think that crime is more frequent in urban areas, but it might just be because [people are more likely to report a crime in urban areas.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15MphYRu66Zspv5IKhBKR-CjYuzVb3u5J/view?usp=drivesdk)

## The Land Value

Building more density does not [hurt the value of your single-family home.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CAjpdHg38B5sIs-ijxQp_MAQHfCXN4ar/view?usp=drivesdk)

## The Apartments

A lot of people in this town are mad about a set of apartments being built. You'd think, "Oh, are they building it on top of a cemetery? A Vietnam war memorial, perhaps?"

No! People just  want to build it on top of a parking lot that's not even paved.

Of course, people have reasons for why they oppose the apartments on that dirt parking lot. 

They worry about [crime rates] and [increased traffic].

They talk about the [environment], even though apartments and five-story buildings are better at conserving nature.

They talk about the ["small-town feel"], a phrase that tells everything and nothing at the same time.

Some say, "but it's not affordable housing!"


## Cadillacs and Corollas

In 2021, there was a shortage of those little computer chips that go into new cars. So, they stopped making as many new cars, and a bunch of rich people who wanted new cars decided to settle for less new cars. 

Of course, nobody makes used cars. So when a bunch of extra people wanted to buy used cars, the price of them went up.

Anyway, so we can see this happen in the housing market. If you stop people from building a six-story apartment on a *dirt parking lot*,

you'll still have the same amount of people, aiming for a limited supply of housing.

Housing prices go up, and the poor lose out. But hey, at least the upper-middle class can keep their parking lot!

It would be such a tragedy if they had to park a bit further away to walk to the lake - or, god forbid, carpool.

## Famine, Affluence, and Morality

Peter Singer posits a hypothetical: "Would you ruin your clothes to save a child from drowning?"

And he carries on that line of conversation, starting with the premise that yes, we *would* be willing to sacrifice a bit of our own comfort to improve the lives of others.

So if we're willing to do that to help someone nearby, why not sacrifice to help someone far away?

```
Are You Afraid Of God? 

No, I'm Afraid Of You.
```

There's this phrase that I keep hearing many variations of: "I worked for everything I got, so everyone else should have to, too". 

Notably, many of those people were privileged enough to be born on the right side of the border, in the right place, in the right time, in the right skin color. Other people work just as hard as them, but circumstances mean that they're not in the same position in life.


The Bioshock series shows worlds where this sentiment is the commanding mantra, and shows the pain and suffering that it brings. What happens in a world run by men with these ideas?
